   This is the notes/codes while taking udacity's backend nano degree. It's a mix of some old materials and looks not so popular. But I do like the style of lecture!

## diff between GET and POST in HTTP

1. GET for static contents
    * if you use GET for delete, some web crawler will make things bad.
    they just click your "delete" links lol

    1. good for requests can be cached
    2. fetching a document

2. POST is not cached, normally it updates something
